export TEST="REPLAC EMENT" assumption for tests


ech"o" -> should result in just one word token
" $TEST " -> one word token, but spaced are included in it
$TEST -> 2 tokens: REPLAC and EMENT
'$TEST' no expansion -> '' are removed
'"$TEST"' no expansion -> '' are removed
"asd$TESTfgh" -> asd (NOT WORKING RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE EXPANDER ALWAYS REPLACES WITH SAME STRING)
"asd$TEST<fgh" -> asdREPLAC EMENT<fgh ->other operators work aswell
$<space> -> should not expand
$ -> should be $ as word token
